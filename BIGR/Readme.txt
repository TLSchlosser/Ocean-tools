Example scripts used to run the BIGR model of Ken Brink. Model available from: https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/10527

Code used for JPO 2019 publication "Observations of Diurnal Coastal-Trapped Waves with a Thermocline-Intensified Velocity Field". Observation data available from: 10.5281/zenodo.1422845.

Myself and Ruth Musgrave made some adjustments to allow it to run without use of a GUI.

If you'd like to see the matfiles I used to run the scripts or need help, feel free to contact me.
