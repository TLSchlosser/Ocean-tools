Wrapper files for moordesign.m, written by Richard Dewey and available from: https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/1629-mooring-design-and-dynamics.

I have created a "run_" file that allows the user to modify the mooring design in an excel file. Statistics on the performance of the mooring for given currents are given to the user.

I have made small modifications to the moordesign.m function, mostly to reduce errors and increase the variables saved.
